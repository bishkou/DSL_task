## Run

```sh
npm run start
```
**My Api Key for foursquare is added to the options object, 
I am aware I shouldn't publish it publicly and it should be in 
an .env file but it's not a problem for now, the repo will be taken down once we are done.**<br>

**I have worked on only one level of 'foreach', so I am assuming there won't be any nested 'foreach',
implementing the nested foreach would be very time consuming for me.**<br>

**The code now fetches places of category 'restaurant' and limit it to just one place and download
the images linked to the restaurant**<br>

**I tried to include all edge cases for 'download' and 'fetch', I hope i didnt miss much**<br>
